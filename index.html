        <p>Table Mountain is probably the first thing you notice as you drive or fly into Cape Town. It is "mesa" that stands ominously above the city. It offers excellent trad climbing with incredible views to go with it. Table Mountain is a National Monument, hence no bolting is allowed. Also, it is almost always possible to protect whatever you might be climbing with removable "trad gear" although there are some fixed pieces in situ. (a 32/8b climb was put up in July 2003). There are several abseil (rappel) points at strategic places; some with bolts and chains to assist with descents. Should you wish to take the cable car to the top, be sure to get there about a half hour prior to opening time to avoid the long queues in tourist season and on the weekends and public holidays in good weather.<br>

        Table Mountain has three main climbing areas that are accessible from the lower cable station. The first two areas can be seen from the lower station and are the two obvious buttresses that are visible up and to the left. The main climbing area that is home to the quality routes is situated on the final 100m or so of rock cliffs that support the upper cable way station on the north-east side (“Africa Ledge”) overlooking the city and also the west side (“Fountain Ledge”) that graces one with the most spectacular views of the Atlantic seaboard and sunsets that get sucked into the ocean.</p>

        <p>Massive Table Mountain National Park stretches from north of Cape Town down the Cape Peninsula to Africa’s southwestern extremity, the Cape of Good Hope. Iconic, flat-topped Table Mountain is its centerpiece. The mountain’s 1,086m summit affords sweeping views of Cape Town and Table Bay, and is reachable by cableway, bicycle, automobile or on foot. The park is also among the world’s richest floral regions.</p>

        <p>Recreational Fishing in and around Cape Town has always been a popular past time. Many fishermen’s journeys are more than likely to end up in Cape Town.  There are excellent fishing spots in a number of places depending on whether you are looking for Big Game Fishing or something more along the lines of a quiet fly-fishing trip. Cape Town also offers both saltwater and freshwater fishing options, raging sea fishing or quiet rivers, streams and trout fishing in dams.</p>
